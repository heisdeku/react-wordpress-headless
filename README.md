# React Wordpres Headless CMS

So, seeing for some past few months and some weeks that it's possible to turn the most powerful CMS I know of, `wordpress` into an API and give it the ability to be plugged into my static sites with any frontend framework, lit up my curiousity and decided to play around before going to build my friend new blog site with Next JS & Wordpres

## Stacks

- NextJS
- Local (Gave me the ability to run wordpress locally)
- Axios (data fetching)
- html react parser (turn JSON contents for post body into html nodes)

## How to run

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
